Qns-3 is a quantum simulator designed based on ns-3 with suitable APIs respecting ns-3â€™s
convention, and adopts the control flow adaptation method as a fundamental technique.

Qns-3 utilizes a discrete-event simulation method to model quantum networks. It leverages a tensor network structure to efficiently represent and manipulate all quantum information involved within the network.
This repository is a module of [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org) (a very famous discrete-event network simulator for internet systems), and uses [ExaTN](https://github.com/ORNL-QCI/exatn) (a software library for expressing, manipulating and processing arbitrary tensor network) as the basic engine. 

## Research Problem

In quantum networks, many protocols can be modeled in the LOCC (local operations and
classical communication) scheme.
In these protocols, classical information received by different parties influences future quantum operations, leading to the required construction of a complex backend to track quantum states if done straightforwardly.
For example, the tensor network method is a powerful technique for classical simulation of quantum information, but as the protocols become more intricate and the number of qubits increases, the contraction complexity of the tensor networks often grows exponentially.
The need to simulate the noise behavior in quantum networks marks as a further challenge for tensor network methods as noises add many new contractions in the tensor network representation.
Additionally, quantum measurements, which bring randomness in the simulation of
quantum network protocols, are another source of complications.
To obtain an average simulation result when verifying a protocol, one may need to employ a Monte Carlo method and run the simulation a large number of times.

The CFA method implemented in qns-3 performs a control flow analysis to
determine the necessary information required for future rounds of the LOCC
protocols.
By compressing and adapting the classical control flow in a way that aligns with
the capabilities of tensor networks, we can efficiently handle the complexities
of many quantum network protocols.
This careful adaptation ensures that the control flow information integrates
seamlessly into the tensor network simulation framework.
Instead of faithfully simulating all quantum measurements and reveals one
possible branch, this method provides a mechanism that is able to integrate all
possible results in a single round.
